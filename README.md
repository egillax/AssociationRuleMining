# AssocationRuleMining



## Introduction

An R package under development, for mining and analysing association rules and frequent patterns using data in the OMOP Common Data Model format. 

## Features

- Implements association rule mining algorithms.
- Implements frequent pattern mining algorithms.

## Technology

AssociationRuleMining is implemented in R, making use of SPMF, an open source data mining library written in Java. More to come soon...

## System Requirements

Requires R (version 3.4.0 and above) and Java.

## Getting Started  
  
- Advanced users are encouraged to have a look at [An introduction for the advanced user](https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/AssociationRuleMining/blob/master/doc/AdvancedUsers.pdf), for a quick overview and how to use the package.  

- In the directory [/extras](https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/AssociationRuleMining/blob/master/extras) there are available .R and .Rmd files ready to be executed against any OMOP-CDM database, once the necessary fields are filled in. 
  
For examples of the complete workflow using the Eunomia package, have a look at
